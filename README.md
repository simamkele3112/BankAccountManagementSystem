Welcome to the BankAccountManagementSystem project! This console-based Java application simulates simple banking operations for checking and savings accounts, allowing users to deposit, withdraw, and calculate interest. It's a straightforward project designed to showcase object-oriented programming principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and exception handling.

📝 Project Description

Deposit to checking and savings accounts
Withdraw funds from the checking account (with balance validation)
Apply interest to the savings account
This project is ideal for demonstrating foundational Java concepts and basic console-based application interaction.
